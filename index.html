<p>
This is not the standard lecture/exam course that we are all used to. Instead, the emphasis of the course is on a semester-long capstone project that synthesizes a number of ideas you have learned in other courses. Typically projects are carried out by teams of two or three. Some projects are software development projects that aim toward full production software systems. Think of Schedulr as a paradigm. Some projects are experimental software development, maybe for the software itself or maybe for the answers that it provides. Think of programs that help with packing problems, investigating ways of putting small shapes into a bigger shape. Some projects are pure research destined to look good on your grad school application, to win you regional and national research awards, and to further your career in academic computer science.
